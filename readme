Assignment #5 readme:

	Program Description:
		This program's purpose is to demonstrate trees, dynamically-allocated memory using malloc, calloc, and free; structs, and functions that operate and manipulate the items mentioned beforehand. As well as generation of random strings and filling in trees with randomly generated data. Sorting, and printing of trees using inorder traversal is also demonstrated and implemented.

Instructions:
	1. Create directory for all assigment files. Or use an existing directory.
	2. Copy or move all source files, including headers, makefile, and Doxyfile to 			created or existing directory.
	3. In Terminal travel to directory that the files were copied or moved into.
	4. Use the "make" (without quotes) command in Terminal in order to both 		compile all the .c files into .o files and to link them into the 			respective executables with their proper dependcies. See the makefile
		for more detail.
	5. To run the programs, use the following command in Terminal:
		Part 1: ./queuetest
		Part 2, 3, 4: ./tnodetest
		Part 5: ./randtree
		Part 6: ./tnodetest & ./randtree
	6. To generate HTML files for the program and code documentation,
		simply use the "make docs" (without quotes) command in Terminal.
		This will generate all the necessary HTML files and copy them to the
		public_html (make sure a directory "assig5" is in the public_html 			folder) folder. The HTML files should then be viewable online.


Thanks.
